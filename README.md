Project Management Project - Solar Power Parking Structure

In the project management project, I utilized MS Project and Gantt charts to effectively manage and track project tasks and timelines. Using MS Project, I created a comprehensive project plan that included task dependencies, resource allocation, and project milestones.
By inputting task durations, dependencies, and resource availability, MS Project generated a Gantt chart that visually represented the project schedule. This allowed me to visualize the project timeline, identify critical paths, and manage task dependencies effectively.
